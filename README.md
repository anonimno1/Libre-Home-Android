### Free and Open Source Domoticz Client built with Android Jetpack

<img src=docs/icon.png height=100/>

Current functionality:
 - display all on/off, dimmable and selector switches from your domoticz
 - allow you to add switches to favorites using long press
 - allow you to group your switches
 - sort switches in several ways
 - check connection
 - restart raspberry pi over ssh (requires ssh configuration)

This is still beta version, so you need to wait a little bit if you want a bug free app. Change logs can be found in `Releases` tab of the repo.

Current version problems:
 - does not support domoticz password
 - some content can remain hidden behind bottom navigation

If you find anything else, please report it. I'm developing the app in my free time!
